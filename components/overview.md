SBGDS ships with a rich set of built-in UI components that you can drop directly into any MDX file — no imports, no configuration, just JSX syntax. These components handle the visual heavy lifting so you can focus on writing great content. Whether you need to highlight a warning, showcase multi-language code samples, or build a visual navigation grid, the component library gives you purpose-built building blocks that look polished out of the box and stay consistent across your entire docs site.

## What are components?

Components are reusable, pre-styled UI elements that extend standard Markdown with interactive and visual functionality. In SBGDS, every component is globally available in MDX files — you never need to write an import statement. Simply use the component's JSX tag anywhere in your content, pass in props as attributes, and SBGDS renders the styled output automatically.

```mdx
<Note>
  This is a note callout. No import required — just use the tag.
</Note>
```

Components follow a consistent design language, respond to your site's light and dark mode settings, and are fully accessible out of the box.

## How to use components in MDX

Using a component is as simple as writing its JSX tag in your `.mdx` file. Close self-closing components with `/>`, and wrap content-bearing components with opening and closing tags:

```mdx
{/* Self-closing component */}
<Card title="Quick Start" icon="rocket" href="/quickstart" />

{/* Content-bearing component */}
<Warning>
  Deleting a workspace is permanent and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

{/* Component with children and props */}
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Authentication" icon="lock" href="/auth" />
  <Card title="API Reference" icon="code" href="/api" />
</CardGroup>
```

Props are passed as JSX attributes. String values use double quotes; numbers and expressions use curly braces.

## Available component categories

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Callouts"
    icon="bell"
    href="/components/callouts"
  >
    Surface important information with Note, Warning, Tip, and Info callouts. Each variant carries a distinct visual treatment to match its urgency level.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Code Blocks"
    icon="code"
    href="/components/code-blocks"
  >
    Display syntax-highlighted code with filenames, line numbers, diffs, focus markers, and multi-language tabs via CodeGroup.
  </Card>

## Next steps

Start with the component pages most relevant to your content type. If you are documenting an API, head to [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) to see `<ParamField>` and `<ResponseField>` in action. If you are writing tutorials, [Cards](/components/cards) and [Code Blocks](/components/code-blocks) are your best first stops.
